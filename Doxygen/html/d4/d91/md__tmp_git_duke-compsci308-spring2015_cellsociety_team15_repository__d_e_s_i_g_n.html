<div class="textblock"><p>#Introduction The goal of this project is to create a program that can run any of four CA simulations, with the possibility of more being added. This will be done by reading in an XML file that contains which CA to run and all of the parameters required for the specific CA simulation.</p>
<p>We want it to make it extendable enough that any number of CA simulations can be added, each with their own parameters. Therefore, the "view" pat of the program should be very flexible. The controller part, where the transitions between different levels will be handled, should also be flexible.</p>
<p>We want to make it so that the basic structure and foundation, so to speak, of the program is closed and doesn't need to be altered. We want to make it flexible in the way that the program handles new simulations being added.</p>
<p>We plan to use the model-view-controller architecture to structure our program.</p>
<p>#Overview The program will be divided up into three sections, in standard model-view-controller ideology. The controller will handle the highest level functions, making sure that everything is running and "delegating" smaller tasks to other classes. The view will deal with the actual simulations and what the user sees. The model package will deal with all of the very specific graphics, such as the red, green, and yellow squares in the fire simulation. I will describe each section in more detail below.</p>
<h2>Controller</h2>
<p>The controller is where the highest level functions of the program will be handled. The classes in here will deal with the general back-end of the program. In our current design, there are four classes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Main</li>
<li>CellSocietyController</li>
<li>FileLoader</li>
<li>XMLParser</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main</h3>
<p>The main will handle the actual running of the program. It will initialize the keyframe/timeline and start the program by calling the largest class in the program, CellSocietyController.</p>
<h3>CellSocietyController</h3>
<p>This class will handle a lot of the large functions and operations of the program. It will start by initializing the splash screen. Then, it will continue to poll different parts of the program to test for transitions between the splash screen and the simulations. This class will also transition back to the fileLoader if the user asks for the program to stop or load a new file. Other user inputs are also processed by the CellSocietyController, including commands to speed up, slow down, step through, and pause/start the simulation.</p>
<h3>XMLParser</h3>
<p>The XMLParser class will take the information it receives from the FileLoader and read through the XML to make it readable for the rest of the program, specifically the simulations. The Parser will do this by creating two objects. The first will be a HashMap that contains all parameter titles as the keys and parameter values as the values. Because HashMaps are mutable, this will allow for extra parameters to be added. The second object will be a 2D ArrayList or a "Grid" object that we create. This object will contain all of the values and statuses of each cell in a grid. It will then be able to check the status of neighbors by using indexing. These are the two main data structures that will be used.</p>
<h2>Model</h2>
<p>The Model package of the program will contain the Simulation superclass wand each specific simulation will be a subclass of Simulation. All the computation involved in updating the grid is done by the packages in this class, and the Model will then pass the status of the colors of each square on the grid on to View class, which uses this information to update the display for the User.</p>
<h3>Simulation Superclass</h3>
<p>This will be the main class that will be extended by all of the individual simulations. It will have methods that create the grid and deal wth updating each individual cell.</p>
<h3>Simulations</h3>
<p>Several extended versions of the Simulation Superclass will be included here. Each one of these will have individual methods that deal with how that specific simulation is updated.</p>
<h2>View</h2>
<p>The view will contain the specific "screens" that need to be displayed to users.</p>
<ul>
<li>SplashScreen</li>
<li>FileLoaderScreen</li>
<li>SimulationScreen</li>
</ul>
<h3>SplashScreen</h3>
<p>The SplashScreen view will have the buttons and text required to introduce the user to the program. They will get instructions and be able to click the "Load File" button, which will take them to the FileLoaderScreen to read in a file and initiate the XMLParser controller classes.</p>
<h3>FileLoaderScreen</h3>
<p>The FileLoaderScreen will be a simple view screen that allows for the user to press a button that launches a FileChooser screen. This will then call the XMLParser to create the primary structures that are used by the program.</p>
<h3>SimulationScreen</h3>
<p>The Simulation Screen will be a view that shows a grid of cells as defined by the user. It will contain a 2D array of Square Nodes to be displayed on the JavaFX Scene. The state of the Squares on the screen are updated by the active Simulation class in the model. It will also buttons that will call commands in the Controller and allow the user to control the simulation as necessary, like pausing, changing speed and stepping forward.</p>
<h2>Other Information</h2>
<p>We are thinking of this design as a "funnel" of sorts. The controller will call down to the model classes which will provide the necessary state of the program to the view classes. Each class will only deal with exactly what it needs to. So, for example, the sprites/graphics in the View will not know anything more than how to return its node to any class that calls it.</p>
<p>#User Interface</p>
<p>The user interface for this program will be relatively simple. When the program runs, the splash screen will open, and the user will have the option to click on a button which will allow the user to load an xml file. As of right now, the splash screen is going to look very simple. It will have a title, maybe Cellular Automata, and a button titled "Load File".</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://github.com/duke-compsci308-spring2015/cellsociety_team15/blob/master/images/Design%20Images/Splash%20Screen.png"  alt="Splash Screen with Error"/>
</div>
<p>When "Load File" is clicked, the explorer will appear which will allow the user to select an xml file that they wish to read in. If they select a file that is incomplete or has errors, the program will return to the splash screen with a new text that says "Error Loading File".</p>
<p>If the file is successfully loaded, the explorer will close and the new simulation screen will appear. The simulation will automatically run. It will look different depending on which model the xml file chose. For example, if the fire starter simulation was indicated in the xml file, the colors will be green, red, and yellow. The other models might have different colors to better indicate what they are modeling. At the top left of simulation screen will be a button that is titled "Load". When clicked, this button will stop the current simulation, and open up the explorer for another xml file to be loaded. In the center there will be two buttons, one titled "Step" which allows the user to step through the simulation, and another button titled "Speed Up" which, while held down" speeds up the rate of the simulation. At the top right there will be a button titled "Stop/Start" which, if the simulation is in a stopped state, continues the simulation, and if the simulation is in a start state, will pause the simulation. See below for reference on location and design of interface.</p>

<p>#Design Details</p>
<h2>Controller</h2>
<h3>Main</h3>
<p>As described above, the sole purpose of this class is to initialize the JavaFX Scene and Timeline and delegates the logic of the program to CellSocietyController.</p>
<h3>CellSocietyController</h3>
<p>CellSocietyController serves as the connecting centerpiece between all the inputs and outputs of the program. It calls the SplashScreen View at the initialization of the program, which brings up a splash screen and waits until the user clicks a button to call the fileLoader, which handles the reading of the simulation parameters. CellSocietyController will pass a 2D ArrayList of the initial grid state, a HashMap of simulation parameters, and a simulation name String to fileLoader, which is supposed to set them according to the XML file that the user chose. CellSociety then looks at the simulation name, picks the appropriate Simulation Model to call and initializes that Model with the appropriate parameters. At the same time, it initializes a SimulationScreen view that is ready to display the grid to the user and take in user input. Any further user input will result in calls to methods in CellSocietyController that in turn call methods in the Simulation to alter its behavior. Another possibility is for the user to reload the simulation, in which case the CellSocietyController will start the loop again and call the fileLoader.</p>
<p>This design pattern for CellSocietyController reflects the most basic, high-level requirements for our CA simulation program. The main functionalities of the class are:</p><ul>
<li>Getting an XML file from the user and parsing it for parameters</li>
<li>Initializing a SimulationScreen and the appropriate Simulation Model</li>
<li>Processing input from the user to control the model</li>
</ul>
<p>In the MVC design pattern, the purpose of the controller is to convert user input into appropriate commands. Our design for the controller satisfies this purpose while working directly only with data structures that we know will be common to all CAs (Grid pattern and a set of configuration parameters) and so it should be flexible and extendable to any new simulations we may want to add.</p>
<h3>XMLParser</h3>
<p>This class is initialized with a file pointer from FileLoader and will contain methods for extracting the data we need from the XML file and storing them in the data structures used by the models; namely the 2D arrayList of initial grid states, the name of the simulation and the HashMap of simulation parameters. The XMLParser represents a low-level class in our program design; it doesn't know what the data is being used for, and it doesn't call methods from other classes but simply returns this data to the FileLoader that asked for it. The XMLParser knows exactly as much as it needs to know.</p>
<h2>Model</h2>
<h3>Simulation Superclass</h3>
<p>The Simulation class is the superclass of individual simulation classes and should define methods that are shared in common among simulations. It will be an abstract class and will define methods for creating and initializing a grid as a List of Square objects, parsing through the HashMap of parameters and setting the parameters as appropriate, and a method for making a step of the model, with helper methods for updating individual Squares. One such helper method would be a method for defining the neighborhood of a square, which by default should be the 8,6, or 3 squares surrounding that square depending on its location in the grid.</p>
<p>These will all be abstract methods to be implemented by the subclasses according to the types of squares in the simulation and the rules for updating the model. Lastly there should be a concrete method for generating a map of square coordinates to colors based on the state of every square and passing this map to a method in the associated Simulation View so that the view is updated.</p>
<p>The data structures that all Simulations should contain at minimum are the List of square objects in the grid and HashMap of square types to Node colors, as read from the HashMap of parameters.</p>
<p>In our design, the Simulation class is meant as the manager of the state of the square grid. It is the only class that directly works with the grid of squares, and its duties are to move the squares around according to the rules of the simulation and to pass the colors of each square in the grid at any given time to the SimulationScreen. CellSocietyController is the class that will call the Simulation's update methods, so it will have control over pausing,resuming and stepping through the simulation, as required by the assignment specification.</p>
<h3>Simulations</h3>
<p>The specific simulation classes will have whatever data structures necessary to compute the state of the square according to the rules of the simulation. However, we have encapsulated the move decision making within the Square subclass objects, and the simulation classes tell the squares to update themselves and return movements in the grid, which the simulation carries out. In general, the process for updating a square will involve evaluating the neighborhood of the square and deciding on a next state based on the properties of the neighborhood. This is intended to be as flexible as possible to accomodate different kinds of simulations; each simulation subclass is meant to have a different implementation of updateSquare with no restrictions on the kind of rules it can implement and it would even be possible to override the superclass method for determining the neighborhood of the square if necessary.</p>
<h3>Square</h3>
<p>The Square object is the lowest level object, representing squares in the grid. As mentioned above, all of the rules and functionality for determining the state of the square are encapsulated within the square. The Square are meant to contain both the information and the logic required to determine the state of the square.</p>
<h2>View</h2>
<h3>SplashScreen</h3>
<p>This Scene will contain information about the program and a button that directs the CellSocietyController to load the FileLoaderScreen once pressed by the user.</p>
<h3>FileLoaderScreen</h3>
<p>This scene will contain a JavaFX FileChooser object to enable to user to load a XML file containing information about the simulation they want to play. The file is then passed on to the XMLParser, which formats the data into data structures to be read by the Simulation objects.</p>
<h3>SimulationScreen</h3>
<p>There will be buttons that allow the user to start/pause, step through, speed up and load a new simulation. ALl of these commands call methods in the CellSocietyController. When initializing the SimulationScreen, the class will have a method to get information about the size of the grid and create Square node objects of an appropriate size to tile the screen according to the number of squares in the grid. It will also have a method that will take in a map of square coordinates to colors from the Simulation class and update the colors of the Square nodes in the Scene accordingly. These functions of the SimulationScreen are completely independent and abstracted from the model, so they should be easily extendable regardless of new features added in the simulation.</p>
<p>#Design Considerations</p>
<p>There are many design considerations for this project. Our goal is to make a design so that each component only has what it needs to know, and no more. To do this we are implementing an MVC, model-view-controller, process. The view consists of the scenes the user will see. This includes the splash screen, simulation screen, and the file loader screen. The model is used to update the view. Its main function will be running the simulations. The controller exists at the highest level and checks for changes in the model, so it may update the model and, in turn, update the view. In terms of design, we decided to use this model because it would most easily allow us to pass down information, without information having to be passed back up. This way we are funneling down information, rather than having it bounce among different levels. Originally we were discussing a model with just a controller and a view, where the view handles all the visuals and the controller handles much of the higher level code, but following the MVC model makes much more sense.</p>
<p>Another design consideration is what data structure is best at handling the xml parser. Ultimately what we decided was using a hashmap to pass in parameters, and an array of arrays, a matrix, to model each pixel in the simulation. We were fairly certain on using the matrix to model the simulation because it seems like the best data structure for this particular assignment. It allows us to split up the screen into a grid and update each chunk individually. The hashmap we decided on using after some consideration. Originally we were thinking about using an arraylist, but the hashmap seemed more organized. With a hashmap we can indicate the parameter name and value.</p>
<p>Finally we discussed how each grid space would contain values. We thought the best way to do this was to simply create a class that extends square, and pass it the appropriate values it needs to interact with its neighbors.</p>
